spark-motionsensor-twilio-nodejs
================================

Spark core is used to detect motion using a Radioshack PIR sensor and Spark.publish() is used to publish motion sensing events. These events are then received by code in nodejs and twilio APIs are used to send a SMS when motion is detected.
